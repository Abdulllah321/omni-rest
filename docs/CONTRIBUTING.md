## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes in src/

# 3. Write tests in test/

# 4. Build and test
npm run build && npm test

# 5. Test in a real app
npm link
cd my-test-app && npm link omni-rest

# 6. Commit
git commit -m "feat: add bulk update support"
```

### Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add ?search= global search param
fix: coerce numeric IDs on findUnique
docs: add cursor pagination example
test: add guard async rejection tests
refactor: split query-builder into filters/pagination
chore: bump tsup to 8.1
```

### Code Style

- Strict TypeScript — no `any` unless documented
- `camelCase` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for types/interfaces
- JSDoc on every exported function
- Functions under 50 lines — split into helpers if larger
- `async/await` everywhere — no callbacks or `.then()` chains

```typescript
/**
 * Parses URLSearchParams into a Prisma-compatible query object.
 * @param searchParams - URL search parameters from the request
 * @param defaultLimit - Default page size (default: 20)
 * @param maxLimit - Maximum allowed page size (default: 100)
 */
export function buildQuery(
  searchParams: URLSearchParams,
  defaultLimit = 20,
  maxLimit = 100
): ParsedQuery {
  // implementation
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                              # run all
npm run test:watch                    # watch mode
npm test -- query-builder.test.ts     # single file
npm test -- --coverage                # with coverage
```

## Contribution Areas

---

## 🟢 Good First Issues

These are self-contained, well-scoped, and a great way to learn the codebase.

---

### #1 — `?search=` Global Search ✅ Implemented

**File:** `src/query-builder.ts`

Add a `?search=` param that queries all `String` fields of a model using OR.

```
GET /api/department?search=eng
→ WHERE name LIKE '%eng%' OR code LIKE '%eng%' OR description LIKE '%eng%'
```

**Implementation:**
- `search` and `fields` added to `RESERVED_KEYS`
- `buildQuery` accepts an optional `modelFields?: FieldMeta[]` parameter
- Filters to non-relation `String` fields and builds `where: { OR: [...] }` with `mode: "insensitive"`
- `router.ts` passes `meta.fields` into `buildQuery`

**Tests:** exact match, partial match, multi-field OR, no string fields (no-op), combined with other filters, `search` not treated as a filter field.

---

### #2 — Soft Delete Support ✅ Implemented

**Files:** `src/router.ts`, `src/introspect.ts`, `src/types.ts`

If a model has `deletedAt: DateTime?` or `isActive: Boolean`, `DELETE` should update that field instead of destroying the record.

```ts
omniRest(prisma, {
  softDelete: true,               // global
  softDeleteField: "deletedAt",  // optional — auto-detected if omitted
})
```

**Auto-detection priority (when `softDeleteField` is omitted):**
1. Field named `deletedAt` with type `DateTime` → set to `new Date()`
2. Field named `isActive` with type `Boolean` → set to `false`
3. No matching field → falls back to hard delete

**GET list** automatically excludes soft-deleted records (`deletedAt: null` / `isActive: true`) when `softDelete: true`.

**Tests:** soft delete updates field, isActive variant, GET list exclusion, fallback to hard delete when field absent, hard delete when option is false.

---

### #3 — `?fields=` Alias for `?select=` ✅ Implemented

**File:** `src/query-builder.ts`

PostgREST uses `?select=`, REST users often expect `?fields=`. One-liner alias in `buildQuery`:

```ts
const selectParam = searchParams.get("select") ?? searchParams.get("fields");
```

Both `select` and `fields` are now in `RESERVED_KEYS`.

**Tests:** both params produce identical output, `?select=` takes precedence when both provided.

---

### #4 — Sort by Relation Count ✅ Implemented

**File:** `src/query-builder.ts`

Support `?sort=_count.posts:desc` — sort by how many related records exist.

```
?sort=_count.posts:desc
→ orderBy: { posts: { _count: "desc" } }
```

The sort parser detects the `_count.` prefix, extracts the relation name, and builds the nested `orderBy` object. Composes with regular sort fields. `ParsedQuery.orderBy` widened to `Record<string, any>` in `src/types.ts`.

**Tests:** `_count.relation:asc`, `_count.relation:desc`, mixed with regular fields, bare `_count` (no dot) treated as regular field, direction defaults to `asc`.

---

### #5 — Response Envelope Option ✅ Implemented

**Files:** `src/router.ts`, `src/types.ts`

Let users disable the `{ data, meta }` wrapper for list endpoints:

```ts
omniRest(prisma, { envelope: false })
// Returns: [...records]   instead of   { data: [...], meta: {...} }
// Sets X-Total-Count header with the total record count
```

`envelope?: boolean` added to `PrismaRestOptions` (default `true`). `HandlerResult` extended with optional `headers?: Record<string, string>` so adapters can forward the `X-Total-Count` header. Single-record GET is unaffected.

**Tests:** envelope on returns `{ data, meta }`, envelope off returns plain array, `X-Total-Count` header set, GET by id unaffected.

---

## 🟡 Intermediate Features

Require understanding of at least two source files. Good for contributors who've done one PR already.

---

### #6 — Nested Relation Filtering ✅ Implemented

**File:** `src/query-builder.ts`

Support dot-notation filters to query through relations:

```
?employees.isActive=true
→ where: { employees: { some: { isActive: true } } }   (isList relation)

?customer.city=Karachi
→ where: { customer: { city: "Karachi" } }              (singular relation)

?author.name_contains=john
→ where: { author: { name: { contains: "john" } } }
```

Dot keys are detected before regular operator matching. `modelFields` determines `isList` → `some: {}` vs direct nesting. Unknown relations and deeply nested keys (two dots) fall through to regular filter handling (documented in code comment).

**Tests:** list relation `some`, singular direct nesting, operator suffix inside dot notation, combined with regular filters, unknown relation graceful fallthrough, no modelFields fallthrough, two-dot deep nesting fallthrough.

---

### #7 — Bulk Operations

**File:** `src/router.ts`, `src/adapters/*.ts`

New endpoint pattern under `/bulk`:

```
POST   /api/department/bulk    → createMany
PUT    /api/department/bulk    → updateMany (body: { where, data })
DELETE /api/department/bulk    → deleteMany (body: { where })
```

Maps to Prisma's `createMany`, `updateMany`, `deleteMany`. Return `{ count: N }`.

**Tests needed:** bulk create returns count, bulk update applies where, bulk delete guard test.

---

### #8 — Field-Level Permissions ✅ Implemented

**Files:** `src/router.ts`, `src/types.ts`

Strip sensitive fields from responses and write bodies:

```ts
omniRest(prisma, {
  fieldGuards: {
    user: {
      hidden:    ["salt"],              // never in any response
      readOnly:  ["id", "createdAt"],  // stripped from POST/PUT body before Prisma
      writeOnly: ["password"],         // never in GET responses
    }
  }
})
```

`FieldGuardConfig` and `FieldGuardMap` types added to `src/types.ts`. `stripResponse()` removes `hidden` + `writeOnly` fields from all responses. `sanitizeBody()` removes `readOnly` fields from write bodies. Works on single records, list responses, and `envelope: false` mode.

**Tests:** hidden absent from GET single/list/POST response, writeOnly absent from GET/PUT response, readOnly stripped from POST/PUT body, unguarded fields unaffected, no fieldGuards = no change, envelope:false still strips.

---

### #9 — Rate Limiting Hook

**File:** `src/middleware.ts`, `src/types.ts`

An optional `rateLimit` function in options, called before every request:

```ts
omniRest(prisma, {
  rateLimit: async ({ model, method, req }) => {
    const key = `${model}:${method}:${req.ip}`;
    const count = await redis.incr(key);
    if (count > 100) return "Rate limit exceeded";
    return null; // allow
  }
})
```

Returns error string to block with 429, or null to allow. Wires into `runGuard` chain in `middleware.ts`.

**Tests needed:** returns 429 when function returns string, passes when returns null, async guard test.

---

### #10 — Hono Adapter

**File:** `src/adapters/hono.ts` (new)

Hono works on Cloudflare Workers, Bun, Deno, and Node. Same pattern as existing adapters.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { honoAdapter } from "omni-rest/hono";

const app = new Hono();
honoAdapter(app, prisma, { allow: ["department"] });
```

**Implementation hint:** Hono's `c.req.param()`, `c.req.query()`, `c.req.json()`, `c.json()` replace Express equivalents. Route pattern: `app.all("/:model/:id?", handler)`.

**Tests needed:** GET list, POST, GET by id, 404 for unknown model.

---

### #11 — Koa Adapter

**File:** `src/adapters/koa.ts` (new)

```ts
import Koa from "koa";
import Router from "@koa/router";
import { koaAdapter } from "omni-rest/koa";

const app = new Koa();
koaAdapter(app, prisma, { allow: ["department"] });
```

Uses `ctx.params`, `ctx.query`, `ctx.request.body`, `ctx.body`, `ctx.status`. Add `koa` and `@koa/router` as optional peer deps.

---

### #12 — Global Error Handler Middleware (Express) ✅ Implemented

**File:** `src/adapters/express.ts`

A drop-in Express error handler that maps Prisma error codes to clean JSON:

```ts
app.use("/api", expressAdapter(prisma));
app.use("/custom", myCustomRoutes);
app.use(omniRestErrorHandler()); // catches P2002, P2025 etc.
```

Maps: `P2025 → 404`, `P2002 → 409 (with field name)`, `P2003 → 400`, `P2014 → 400`, unknown Prisma codes `→ 500`, non-Prisma errors pass through to `next()`. Also updated `expressAdapter` to forward `HandlerResult.headers` to the response.

**Tests:** all Prisma code mappings, non-Prisma passthrough, middleware arity check.

---

## 🔴 Advanced Features

These require designing a new subsystem. Open a discussion issue first before implementing.

---

### #13 — Cursor-Based Pagination

**File:** `src/query-builder.ts`, `src/router.ts`, `src/types.ts`

Alongside offset pagination, add cursor mode — much faster on large tables:

```
GET /api/user?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTV9&limit=20
→ Response includes nextCursor token for the next page
```

```ts
// Response shape in cursor mode:
{
  data: [...],
  nextCursor: "eyJpZCI6MzV9",  // base64 encoded { id: 35 }
  hasMore: true
}
```

Cursor is base64 JSON of `{ [idField]: lastId }`. Use `prisma.findMany({ cursor: ..., skip: 1 })`.

**Design first** — open a discussion about response shape before implementing.

---

### #14 — Aggregation Endpoints

**File:** `src/router.ts`, `src/types.ts`

```
GET /api/department/aggregate?_count=*&_sum=salary&_avg=salary&_min=salary&_max=salary
GET /api/department/groupBy?by=city&_count=*
```

Maps to Prisma's `aggregate()` and `groupBy()`. These are new route patterns — add alongside existing collection/resource routes.

**Design first** — URL schema needs discussion. See PostgREST's aggregation design for reference.

---

### #15 — Query Complexity Limiting

**File:** `src/middleware.ts`, `src/query-builder.ts`

Score each query before execution. Reject if above threshold:

```ts
omniRest(prisma, {
  complexity: {
    maxScore: 100,
    rules: {
      perInclude: 10,       // each ?include= relation adds 10
      perFilter: 2,         // each filter adds 2
      perLimit100: 5,       // every 100 records in limit adds 5
    }
  }
})
```

Returns `429 Query too complex` with score breakdown if exceeded.

---

### #16 — Server-Sent Events Subscriptions

**File:** `src/adapters/express.ts`, new `src/subscriptions.ts`

```
GET /api/department/subscribe   → SSE stream of changes
```

Streams `create`, `update`, `delete` events to connected clients. Use Prisma's `$on("query")` events + polling fallback.

```ts
// Client receives:
data: {"event":"create","model":"Department","data":{"id":5,"name":"Engineering"}}
data: {"event":"update","model":"Department","data":{"id":5,"name":"Eng Updated"}}
```

This is the most complex feature on the list — requires connection lifecycle, heartbeat, reconnect handling.

---

### #17 — Auto-generated TypeScript Client SDK

**New sub-package:** `omni-rest-client`

Reads the OpenAPI spec (or DMMF directly) and generates a fully-typed fetch client:

```ts
import { createClient } from "omni-rest-client";

const api = createClient("http://localhost:3000/api");

const { data, meta } = await api.department.findMany({ where: { isActive: true } });
const dept = await api.department.findById(5);
await api.department.create({ name: "Engineering" });
await api.department.update(5, { name: "Eng" });
await api.department.delete(5);
```

Fully typed from DMMF — `api.department.create()` knows which fields are required.

---

### #18 — Plugin Architecture

**File:** `src/types.ts`, `src/router.ts`, `src/middleware.ts`

A formal plugin system that lets third parties extend omni-rest without forking:

```ts
omniRest(prisma, {
  plugins: [
    auditLogPlugin({ storage: prisma }),
    cachePlugin({ ttl: 60, store: redisClient }),
    rateLimitPlugin({ max: 100, window: "1m" }),
  ]
})
```

Each plugin is an object with optional lifecycle methods:

```ts
interface OmniRestPlugin {
  name: string;
  beforeOperation?: HookFn;
  afterOperation?: HookFn;
  onError?: (error: any, ctx: HookContext) => HandlerResult | null;
  transformResponse?: (data: any, ctx: HookContext) => any;
  transformBody?: (body: any, ctx: HookContext) => any;
}
```

**Design first** — this is the most architecturally significant feature. Needs RFC discussion.

---

## 📦 New Adapters

Every new adapter follows the same contract — map the framework's request/response to `handle()`:

```ts
const { status, data } = await handle(method, modelName, id, body, searchParams);
```

| Adapter | Issue | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
| Hono | #10 | Intermediate |
| Koa | #11 | Intermediate |
| NestJS | future | Advanced |
| Elysia (Bun) | future | Intermediate |
| SvelteKit | future | Intermediate |
| SolidStart | future | Intermediate |

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- **Minimum 80% coverage** before any PR merges
- Every new feature needs tests in `test/`
- Use `mockPrisma` and `mockDMMF` from `test/fixtures/` — never spin up a real DB in unit tests
- Integration tests (real DB) go in `test/integration/` and are opt-in

```bash
npm test -- --coverage     # check coverage
npm test -- --reporter=verbose  # detailed output
```

---

## 📄 Docs & DX

Documentation contributions are equally valuable:

- Fix typos, unclear explanations → always welcome, no issue needed
- Add a framework example → create issue first, link to example app
- Add a recipe (auth, audit log, etc.) → `docs/recipes/` folder
- Improve CLI help text → `src/cli.ts`
- Add JSDoc to exported functions → always welcome
